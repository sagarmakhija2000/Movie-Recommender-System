A recommendation engine filters the data using different algorithms and recommends the most relevant items to users. This Python Project recommends The user what he might be interested in based on the previous movie he/she watched
Make sure the dataset is in the same folder as the python program(unless you know what you are doing)

This is a small dataset with the data of around 4800 movies, you can look at the other stuff in project_report
